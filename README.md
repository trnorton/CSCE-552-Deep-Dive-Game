“Deep Dive!” is a 2D video game from a side-on perspective. In this game, the player is a submarine that must dive down to the bottom of the ocean to collect a sunken treasure, then return to the top of the ocean. However, the player must be careful because there are various sea creatures such as sharks and giant squid that they could run into during their journey. Either zoom past these foes or shoot them with your torpedoes to avoid taking damage. Can you brave the depths of the ocean and attain great riches?
